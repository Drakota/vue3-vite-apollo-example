# Caveats âš 

## GraphQL-Codegen

The project uses `graphql-codegen` for generating queries for Vue's composition API that are type-safe and outputs its content into `src/gql/index.ts`, but there doesn't seems to be a way to change how `graphql-codegen` does their imports to adapt for Vite at the moment.

```ts
// We need to manually change this in src/gql/index.ts
import * as VueApolloComposable from "@vue/apollo-composable";
import * as VueCompositionApi from "@vue/composition-api";
// To this because we are using Vite
import VueApolloComposable from "@vue/apollo-composable";
import VueCompositionApi from "@vue/composition-api";
```

## Vetur Interpolation

While using [Vetur's template interpolation service](https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/interpolation.html), we can also see that the type of the `usePagesQuery`'s result isn't properly getting inferred when checking for null value before iterating over.
